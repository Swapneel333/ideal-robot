# ideal-robot
This project is based on the dataset of a training firm.
Used python and machine learning algorithms for solving this classification problem. 
Used algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest and KNN. 
Predicted the passing rate of students across different training programmes 
Hyper-parameter tuning was done to get the required settings and solution was served.
